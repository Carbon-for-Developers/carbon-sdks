Make sure that your API key has the permission to read solutions from your account and you are on a &lt;b&gt;paid&lt;/b&gt; plan. Once you have an API key, you can make a request to this endpoint along with your freshdesk domain. This will  trigger an automatic sync of the articles in your \&quot;solutions\&quot; tab.

  # Once you have successfully connected your gmail account, you can choose which emails to sync with us using the filters parameter. Filters is a JSON object with key value pairs. It also supports AND and OR operations. For now, we support a limited set of keys listed below.  &lt;b&gt;label&lt;/b&gt;: Inbuilt Gmail labels, for example \&quot;Important\&quot; or a custom label you created.   &lt;b&gt;after&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;before&lt;/b&gt;: A date in YYYY/mm/dd format (example 2023/12/31). Gets emails after/before a certain date. You can also use them in combination to get emails from a certain period.   &lt;b&gt;is&lt;/b&gt;: Can have the following values - starred, important, snoozed, and unread    Using keys or values outside of the specified values can lead to unexpected behaviour.  An example of a basic query with filters can be &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;json {     \&quot;filters\&quot;: {             \&quot;key\&quot;: \&quot;label\&quot;,             \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;Test\&quot;         } } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; Which will list all emails that have the label \&quot;Test\&quot;.  You can use AND and OR operation in the following way: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;json {     \&quot;filters\&quot;: {         \&quot;AND\&quot;: [             {                 \&quot;key\&quot;: \&quot;after\&quot;,                 \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;2024/01/07\&quot;             },             {                 \&quot;OR\&quot;: [                     {                         \&quot;key\&quot;: \&quot;label\&quot;,                         \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;Personal\&quot;                     },                     {                         \&quot;key\&quot;: \&quot;is\&quot;,                         \&quot;value\&quot;: \&quot;starred\&quot;                     }                 ]             }         ]     } } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; This will return emails after 7th of Jan that are either starred or have the label \&quot;Personal\&quot;.  Note that this is the highest level of nesting we support, i.e. you can&#39;t add more AND/OR filters within the OR filter in the above example.
