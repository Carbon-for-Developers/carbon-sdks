      "description": "\n---\nCarbon offers a set of webhooks for a variety of events, listed below. Currently, there is no way to choose\nwhich events to receive webhooks for - it's on our roadmap to allow for more fine-grained filtering. The steps\nin setting up webhooks for your service are:\n1. Add a URL to which webhoooks should be sent. This can be done using the `/add_webhook` endpoint.\n2. Save the `signing_key` in the response somewhere safe - this can't be retrieved again.\n\nAt this point, all events will be sent to the URL specified in step 1. An event - sent via an HTTP POST\nrequest - contains two important elements, a `Carbon-Signature` header and a body with a single key-value pair.\nYou can validate the authenticity and integrity of the webhook by calculating its signature. To do this, you should:\n1. Extract the timestamp and signature.\n    1. Extract the timestamp and signature from the `Carbon-Signature` header. It will be of the form\n`Carbon-Signature:t=1492774577,v1=5257a869e7ecebeda32affa62cdca3fa51cad7e77a0e56ff536d0ce8e108d8bd`.\n    2. For those using JavaScript and decoding the request json via `JSON.stringify`, we suggest using the `Carbon-Signature-Compact`\nheader instead. It will have the form `Carbon-Signature:t=1492774577,v2=5257a869e7ecebeda32affa62cdca3fa51cad7e77a0e56ff536d0ce8e108d8bd`.\n2. Create a string of the form `{timestamp}.{request_body}`, where `request_body` is the entire request body.\nNote that all values in the webhook request body are coerced to strings - this is *intentional*.\n    1. If using `Carbon-Signature`, you can use `request_body` as is, or you can decode it as json. When decoding, ensure that the \nresulting json is formatted *exactly* as it is in `request_body`. In other words, the json should look like:\n```\n{\"x\": 5, \"y\": 6}\n```\n    2. If using `Carbon-Signature-V2`, when decoding the request body, ensure that the resulting json is in compact form, where there \nare no spaces between key-value pairs or between keys and values. For example,\n```\n{\"x\":5,\"y\":6}\n```\nGiven a request body, `x`, you can do this in Python via `json.dumps(x, separators=[\",\", \":\"])` or in JavaScript via `JSON.stringify(x)`.\n3. Compute an HMAC of the above string with the SHA256 hash function. Use `signing_key` obtained from the `/add_webhook` endpoint as the key.\n4. Compare the computed signature with the signature in the header (the value that `v1` - or `v2` - is equal to). If they're identical,\nyou can be assured that the webhook is both genuine and hasn't been tampered with.\n\nOnce you receive and handle the webhook, you should respond to the POST request with a 200 status - otherwise the webhook\nwill be retried (up to three times).\n\n### Webhooks for File Processing\n\nWe currently support the following webhook events for file processing:\n1. `FILE_READY`\n    - Sent after a file has been fully processed and added to Carbon.\n2. `FILE_ERROR`\n    - Sent if there was an error during the file processing stage. If an error occurred, the file is requeued for reprocessing\n    up to three times.\n3. `FILE_DELETED`\n    - Sent if a file has been successfully deleted.\n4. `RATE_LIMIT_ERROR`\n    - Sent if the organization has reached the rate limit for file processing. In this case, the file is requeued for reprocessing\n    up to three times.\n\nThese are sent *after* a file has been processed.\n\n### Webhooks for Data Sources\n\nWe currently support the following webhook events for managing user connections to data sources:\n\n1. `ADD` \n    - This event is fired when a user authenticates their account for a specific data source for the first time.\n\n2. `UPDATE` \n    - This event is fired when a user selects one or more files for a particular data source. This event is fired once per file selection confirmation, regardless of how many files are selected.\n\n3. `CANCEL` \n    - This event is fired when a user cancels the authentication flow. It's important to note that this event cannot capture tab-close events, so directly closing a tab is not within our tracking capabilities.\n\n4. `REVOKE`\n    - This event is triggered when a user's data source connection is revoked via the `/revoke_access_token` endpoint.\n\nAn organization is allowed up to *3* webhook URLs. To delete an existing URL, you can use the `/delete_webhook` endpoint.\nTo view all existing webhooks, use the `/webhooks` endpoint.\n\nAll webhook payloads have the form\n```\n{\n    \"payload\": str\n}\n```\nThe value of `payload` (which is a stringified json object) will always have the form\n```\n{\n    \"webhook_type\": WebhookType,\n    \"obj\": {\n        \"object_type\": WebhookObjectType,\n        \"object_id\": str,\n        \"additional_information\": dict[str, str] | str\n    },\n    \"timestamp\": str\n}\n```\nNote that `WebhookType` is one of the webhook events described above. `WebhookObjectType` is limited to `FILE` currently.\n`additional_information` is always a dictionary of string-string key-value pairs, unless it's empty, in which case it is\nthe string value \"null\". Finally, `timestamp` is an int POSIX timestamp as a string. Note that to use `object_id` in\nsubsequent API requests, you'll likely need to convert it to an int.\n",

In cases where vector (or neural) search isn't optimal, Carbon also supports keyword-based searches.\n\nCarbon simplifies the process of **retrieval augmented generation** (RAG), allowing you to spend more time using your data, and less time trying to ingest it.\n\n## How Carbon Works\n\nUse **[Carbon Connect](https://api.carbon.ai/redoc#tag/Carbon-Connect)** to connect to your users' data sources and then our **Universal API** to retrieve the data to use with LLMs. Carbon has native integrations with 10+ data sources and supports more than 20+ file formats, encompassing text, audio, and visual data.\n\nDepending on your use case and in-house infrastructure, you can retrieve user data from Carbon in several formats: \n\n- Parsed plaintext files\n- Embeddings (and chunks) to store in your vector store\n- Direct semantic and keyword search against Carbon's managed vector database\n\n## Products\n\n### 🔗 Connect\n\nA client-side component for users to connect data sources such as Notion, Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, websites, and file uploads. Available as a React component, JavaScript SDK, and soon as a magic link. \n\nCarbon handles OAuth flows for 10+ sources, transforms the source data, and automates data synchronization.\n\n### 🗄️ Store\n\nChoose between Carbon's managed vector database (hosted on Qdrant Cloud) or your storage solution. The database updates as users modify connected sources and manage chunks alongside embeddings.\n\n### 🔌 Universal API\n\nAccess and manage data (documents, chunks, vectors, etc.) from any source using our flexible API suite. Apply custom metadata filters to objects for tailored data retrieval.\n\n## Setup\n\n---\n\n### 🔑 Getting a Carbon API Key\n\nCarbon is free to use up to the first 20 million characters. \nBook a 15 minute onboarding to get an API key [here](https://cal.com/carbon-ai/15min).\n\n### 🔗 Helpful Links\nTo get started with Carbon, follow our guides:\n\n- [Installing Carbon Connect](https://api.carbon.ai/redoc#tag/Carbon-Connect)\n- [Integrating Data Sources](https://api.carbon.ai/redoc#tag/Data-Sources)\n\n",

Please ignore the warning and proceed to connect your account. We will update this section once our app is approved.\n\n## Usage\n\n---\n\nThis section demonstrates how to integrate the CarbonConnect component within a Next.js project.\n\n### Client Side Configuration\n\n1. Import necessary libraries and components:\n\n```jsx\nimport { CarbonConnect } from 'carbon-connect';\nimport axios from 'axios';\n```\n\n2. Token Retrieval:\n  The tokenFetcher function is set up to request access tokens from Carbon directly via your backend:\n\n```js\nconst tokenFetcher = async () => {\n  const response = await axios.get('/api/auth/fetchCarbonTokens', {\n    params: { customer_id: 'your_customer_id' },\n  });\n  return response.data; // Must return data containing access_token\n};\n```\n  In the example above, tokenFetcher is a helper function that retrieves the necessary tokens for authentication. This function should be implemented in your client-side code and is designed to make a request to an API on your backend server. The API then requests tokens from the Carbon token creation endpoint. The Carbon token creation endpoint is a secure endpoint that requires a valid API key and customer ID. The customer ID is a unique identifier for your end-user, and you can pass any string as the customer ID. The API key is a secret key provided to you by Carbon. Please contact us to obtain your API key.\n\n3. Implement CarbonConnect Component:\n   Here's a concise usage example. Customize according to your requirements:\n\n```jsx\n<CarbonConnect\n  orgName=\"Your Organization\"\n  brandIcon=\"path/to/your/brand/icon\"\n  tokenFetcher={tokenFetcher}\n  tags={{\n    tag1: 'tag1_value',\n    tag2: 'tag2_value',\n    tag3: 'tag3_value',\n  }}\n  maxFileSize={10000000}\n  enabledIntegrations={[\n    {\n      id: 'LOCAL_FILES',\n      chunkSize: 100,\n      overlapSize: 10,\n      maxFileSize: 20000000,\n      allowMultipleFiles: true,\n      maxFilesCount: 5,\n      allowedFileTypes: [\n        {\n          extension: 'csv',\n          chunkSize: 1200,\n          overlapSize: 120,\n        },\n        {\n          extension: 'txt',\n          chunkSize: 1599,\n          overlapSize: 210,\n        },\n        {\n          extension: 'pdf',\n        },\n      ],\n    },\n    {\n      id: 'NOTION',\n      chunkSize: 1500,\n      overlapSize: 20,\n    },\n    {\n      id: 'WEB_SCRAPER',\n      chunkSize: 1500,\n      overlapSize: 20,\n    },\n    {\n      id: 'GOOGLE_DRIVE',\n      chunkSize: 1000,\n      overlapSize: 20,\n    },\n  ]}\n  onSuccess={(data) => console.log('Data on Success: ', data)}\n  onError={(error) => console.log('Data on Error: ', error)}\n  primaryBackgroundColor=\"#F2F2F2\"\n  primaryTextColor=\"#555555\"\n  secondaryBackgroundColor=\"#f2f2f2\"\n  secondaryTextColor=\"#000000\"\n  allowMultipleFiles={true}\n  open={true}\n  chunkSize={1500}\n  overlapSize={20}\n  // entryPoint=\"LOCAL_FILES\"\n></CarbonConnect>\n```\n\n### Server Side Configuration\n\nYour backend should handle token requests like this:\n\n```js\nconst response = await axios.get('https://api.carbon.ai/auth/v1/access_token', {\n  headers: {\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n    'customer-id': '<YOUR_USER_UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER>',\n    authorization: 'Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>',\n  },\n});\nif (response.status === 200 && response.data) {\n  res.status(200).json(response.data);\n}\n```\n\n### Return Value Expectation:\n\nEnsure that your tokenFetcher returns an object structured as:\n\n```js\n{\n  access_token: string;\n}\n```\n\n## Enable Data Sources\n\n---\n\nAnother important prop is enabledIntegrations. This prop lets you choose which integrations to show in the component. You can also pass additional configuration for each integration. We have provided an example in the above code snippet. Here is the list of all the integrations that you can enable:\n\n1. `LOCAL_FILES`: This integration lets you upload files from your local machine.

Defaults to 100.\n    - `skipEmbeddingGeneration`: Whether or not to skip embeddings generation. Defaults to `false`.\n\n4. `GOOGLE_DRIVE`: This integration lets you upload files from your Google Drive. You can pass the following configuration for this integration:\n   - `chunkSize`: This is the no.of tokens per chunk. Defaults to 1500.\n   - `overlapSize`: This is the size of the overlap in tokens. Defaults to 20.\n   - `skipEmbeddingGeneration`: Whether or not to skip embeddings generation. Defaults to `false`.\n\n5. `INTERCOM`: This integration lets you select pages from your Intercom.

Defaults to `false`.\n\n## Callback Function Props\n\n---\n\n1.  `onError`: CC will also call another call back method if there is an error while uploading file. This function will pass data in the following format:\n\n```js\n{\n  status: 400,\n  action: 'UPDATE',\n  event: 'UPDATE',\n  integration: `<INTEGRATION_NAME>`, // 'LOCAL_FILES' or 'WEB_SCRAPER',\n  data: `<data_object>`, // This field will be present only if the error is related to a file or web scraper\n}\n```\n\n2. `onSuccess`: You can let CC trigger a callback function upon successful file upload, 3rd party account connection and file selection, Webscraping request initiation.\n\n  ### `onSuccess`` Event Types\n\n  1. `INITIATE`: This event type is triggered when a user enters the integration flow (either for auth or file selection)\n  2. `ADD`: This event type is triggered when a user authenticates an account under an integration.\n  3. `UPDATE`: This event type is triggered when a user adds or removes files for an integration. We’ll list the files added or removed.\n  4. `CANCEL`: This event type is triggered when when a user exits the integration flow without taking any action.\n\n\n  ### Data passed to `onSuccess` callback\n\n  The data passed to the onSuccess callback prop will be:\n\n  1. For `LOCAL_FILES`: \n\n  ```js\n  {\n    status: 200,\n    data: {\n      \"data_source_external_id\": null, // This field is not applicable for local files\n      \"sync_status\": null, // This is not applicable for local files\n      \"files\": <Array of objects corresponding to the files uploaded>, (Refer to the file object format below)\n    },\n    action: 'UPDATE'\n    event: 'UPDATE'\n    integration: 'LOCAL_FILES',\n  }\n  ```\n\n  2. For `WEB_SCRAPER`: An array containing only one object in the following format\n\n  ```js\n  {\n    status: 200,\n    data: {\n      \"data_source_external_id\": null, // This field is not applicable for webscrapers\n      \"sync_status\": null, // This is not applicable for webscrapers\n      \"files\": <Array of objects corresponding to the parent URLs submitted>, (Refer to the file object format below)\n    },\n    action: 'UPDATE'\n    event: 'UPDATE'\n    integration: 'WEB_SCRAPER',\n  }\n\n  ```\n\n  3. For third party integrations: An array of objects. Each object will be in the following format:\n\n  ```js\n  {\n    status: 200,\n    data: {\n      \"data_source_external_id\": <Unique ID for the data source>,\n      \"sync_status\": <SYNC_STATUS>,\n      \"files\": <Array of objects corresponding to the files / pages selected>,\n    } or null,\n    action: <ACTION_TYPE>, // `ACTION_TYPE` can be one of the following: `INITIATE`, `ADD`, `UPDATE`, `CANCEL`\n    event: <EVENT_TYPE>, // `EVENT_TYPE` can be one of the following: `INITIATE`, `ADD`, `UPDATE`, `CANCEL`\n    integration: <INTEGRATION_NAME>, // `INTEGRATION_NAME` can be one of the following: `LOCAL_FILES`, `NOTION`, `WEB_SCRAPER`, `GOOGLE_DRIVE`, `INTERCOM`, `DROPBOX`, `ONEDRIVE`\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Each file object will be in the following format:\n\n  ```js\n  {\n      \"id\": `Unique ID for the file, can be used for resyncing, deleting, updating tags etc.`,\n      \"source\": `<integration_name>`, // One among `LOCAL_FILES`, `NOTION`, `WEB_SCRAPER`, `GOOGLE_DRIVE`, `INTERCOM`, `DROPBOX`, `ONEDRIVE`\n      \"organization_id\": `<organization_id>`, // This is your unique organization id in carbon\n      \"organization_supplied_user_id\": `<organization_supplied_user_id>`, // This is the unique user id that you pass to CC\n      \"organization_user_data_source_id\": `<organization_user_data_source_id>`, // This is the unique user data source id that CC creates for each user for each integration\n      \"external_file_id\": `<external_file_id>`, // This is the unique file id in the 3rd party integration\n      \"external_url\": `<external_url>`, // This is the unique url of the file in the 3rd party integration\n      \"sync_status\": `<sync_status>`, // This is the sync status of the file.

        "description": "For pre-filtering documents, using `tags_v2` is preferred to using `tags` (which is now deprecated). If both `tags_v2`\nand `tags` are specified, `tags` is ignored. `tags_v2` enables\nbuilding complex filters through the use of \"AND\", \"OR\", and negation logic. Take the below input as an example:\n```json\n{\n    \"OR\": [\n        {\n            \"key\": \"subject\",\n            \"value\": \"holy-bible\",\n            \"negate\": false\n        },\n        {\n            \"key\": \"person-of-interest\",\n            \"value\": \"jesus christ\",\n            \"negate\": false\n        },\n        {\n            \"key\": \"genre\",\n            \"value\": \"religion\",\n            \"negate\": true\n        }\n        {\n            \"AND\": [\n                {\n                    \"key\": \"subject\",\n                    \"value\": \"tao-te-ching\",\n                    \"negate\": false\n                },\n                {\n                    \"key\": \"author\",\n                    \"value\": \"lao-tzu\",\n                    \"negate\": false\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nIn this case, files will be filtered such that:\n1. \"subject\" = \"holy-bible\" OR\n2. \"person-of-interest\" = \"jesus christ\" OR\n3. \"genre\" != \"religion\" OR\n4. \"subject\" = \"tao-te-ching\" AND \"author\" = \"lao-tzu\"\n\nNote that the top level of the query must be either an \"OR\" or \"AND\" array. Currently, nesting is limited to 3.\nFor tag blocks (those with \"key\", \"value\", and \"negate\" keys), the following typing rules apply:\n1. \"key\" isn't optional and must be a `string`\n2. \"value\" isn't optional and can be `any` or list[`any`]\n3. \"negate\" is optional and must be `true` or `false`. If present and `true`, then the filter block is negated in\nthe resulting query. It is `false` by default.\n\n\nWhen querying embeddings, you can optionally specify the `media_type` parameter in your request. By default (if\nnot set), it is equal to \"TEXT\". This means that the query will be performed over files that have\nbeen parsed as text (for now, this covers all files except image files). If it is equal to \"IMAGE\",\nthe query will be performed over image files (for now, `.jpg` and `.png` files). You can think of this\nfield as an additional filter on top of any filters set in `file_ids` and\n\n\nWhen `hybrid_search` is set to true, a combination of keyword search and semantic search are used to rank\nand select candidate embeddings during information retrieval. By default, these search methods are weighted\nequally during the ranking process. To adjust the weight (or \"importance\") of each search method, you can use\nthe `hybrid_search_tuning_parameters` property. The description for the different tuning parameters are:\n- `weight_a`: weight to assign to semantic search\n- `weight_b`: weight to assign to keyword search\n\nYou must ensure that `sum(weight_a, weight_b,..., weight_n)` for all *n* weights is equal to 1. The equality\nhas an error tolerance of 0.001 to account for possible floating point issues.\n\nIn order to use hybrid search for a customer across a set of documents, two flags need to be enabled:\n1. Use the `/modify_user_configuration` endpoint to to enable `sparse_vectors` for the customer. The payload\nbody for this request is below:\n```\n{\n  \"configuration_key_name\": \"sparse_vectors\",\n  \"value\": {\n    \"enabled\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n2. Make sure hybrid search is enabled for the documents across which you want to perform the search. For the\n`/uploadfile` endpoint, this can be done by setting the following query parameter: `generate_sparse_vectors=true`\n\n\nCarbon supports multiple models for use in generating embeddings for files. For images, we support Vertex AI's\nmultimodal model; for text, we support OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` and Cohere's embed-multilingual-v3.0.\nThe model can be specified via the `embedding_model` parameter (in the POST body for `/embeddings`, and a query \nparameter in `/uploadfile`). If no model is supplied, the `text-embedding-ada-002` is used by default. When performing\nembedding queries, embeddings from files that used the specified model will be considered in the query.\nFor example, if files A and B have embeddings generated with `OPENAI`, and files C and D have embeddings generated with\n`COHERE_MULTILINGUAL_V3`, then by default, queries will only consider files A and B. If `COHERE_MULTILINGUAL_V3` is\nspecified as the `embedding_model` in `/embeddings`, then only files C and D will be considered. Make sure that\nthe set of all files you want considered for a query have embeddings generated via the same model. For now, **do not**\nset `VERTEX_MULTIMODAL` as an `embedding_model`. This model is used automatically by Carbon when it detects an image file.",

For images, we support Vertex AI's\nmultimodal model; for text, we support OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` and Cohere's embed-multilingual-v3.0.\nThe model can be specified via the `embedding_model` parameter (in the POST body for `/embeddings`, and a query \nparameter in `/uploadfile`). If no model is supplied, the `text-embedding-ada-002` is used by default. When performing\nembedding queries, embeddings from files that used the specified model will be considered in the query.\nFor example, if files A and B have embeddings generated with `OPENAI`, and files C and D have embeddings generated with\n`COHERE_MULTILINGUAL_V3`, then by default, queries will only consider files A and B. If `COHERE_MULTILINGUAL_V3` is\nspecified as the `embedding_model` in `/embeddings`, then only files C and D will be considered. Make sure that\nthe set of all files you want considered for a query have embeddings generated via the same model. For now, **do not**\nset `VERTEX_MULTIMODAL` as an `embedding_model`. This model is used automatically by Carbon when it detects an image file.",

Currently, nesting is limited to 3.\nFor tag blocks (those with \"key\", \"value\", and \"negate\" keys), the following typing rules apply:\n1. \"key\" isn't optional and must be a `string`\n2. \"value\" isn't optional and can be `any` or list[`any`]\n3. \"negate\" is optional and must be `true` or `false`. If present and `true`, then the filter block is negated in\nthe resulting query. It is `false` by default.",
